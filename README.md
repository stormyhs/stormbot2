# StormBot Lite, by stormy

A cleaned up version of StormBot, made open-source. Now using real databases!!!

---

## Why are half the commands missing?
Because the code was garbage. Since this is a cleaned up version, I am adding all the old commands one by one, as I re-write them.

Priorities are the shop, items, and battles.

Blackjack is the exception. I kept it in due to it being fun. I'll clean it up when I care.

## Why is the naming so inconsistent?
Because I like being quirky like that.
